## Goal

The goal of this project was to identify the key aspects of hospital care that have the greatest impact on hospital ratings and recommendation scores. By understanding these drivers, hospitals can make targeted improvements to enhance patient satisfaction, optimize resource allocation, and strengthen their reputation. Since hospital ratings and recommendations directly influence financial performance, patient trust, and operational success, prioritizing high-impact areas ensures strategic, data-driven enhancements that yield measurable benefits.

## Process

I sourced the “Patient Survey (HCAHPS) - Hospital” dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, covering inpatient experiences from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. Using MySQL, I cleaned the data by handling missing values, fixing formatting issues, and removing unusable rows to enhance data processing efficiency. I integrated U.S. county population data (2024) from the U.S. Census Bureau to provide additional insights. After extracting key hospital performance measures, I exported the dataset to Excel to create a correlation matrix and conducted regression analysis to determine which factors most influence hospital ratings and recommendations. Finally, I visualized the results with bar charts to highlight the strongest predictors of hospital performance.

## Key Finding

Care transition, nurse communication, and doctor communication have the largest effect on hospital ratings and recommendation scores.
